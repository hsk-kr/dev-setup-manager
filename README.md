## Features

1. Tools

You can install tools, with most being installed via Homebrew.
Note: This script does not install Homebrew itself. You'll need to install Homebrew manually beforehand.

2. Dotfiles

It downloads [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/hsk-kr/dotfiles) and creates soft links under `.config`.
The repository will be cloned into the dev-setup-manager directory within your home directory.

3. Guide

Some configurations and installations may not proceed as smoothly as expected. These notes highlight important considerations during setup.
